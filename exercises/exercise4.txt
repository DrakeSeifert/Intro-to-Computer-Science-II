We have problems, solutions, questions, and answers in code.

When looking for help we have many options:
	google, cplusplus.org, jen's slides, old code examples, other students, TA's,
	jennifer, the book, stack overflow, youtube, etc.

Google how to's:
	put importance from high to low for words in your search:
		c++ edit a file
		NOT edit a file c++

	also adding "solved" to the end will help:
		c++ edit a file solved

	Adding quotes around a block of text will make it search all together:
		c++ "edit a file" solved

	To exclude a search result, add a dash:
		c++ "edit a file" solved -C


Look up how to use EOF

movie type;
	while(!EOF) {
		iostream.get(tmp.index, 256, '|');
		//get rating
		//get title

		if(!strcmp(tmp.time, t)
			print tmp;
	}
